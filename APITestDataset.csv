1,    Another priceless gem from yourself demonstrating your general cluelessness The fuse rating and therefore the plug rating in the case of a nonrewireable plug is determined by the cable attached not the appliance it will be used with Where on earth did you dig that nonsense up from There are plenty of good examples around but medium to large switch mode power supplies are often supplied with nominally 3 Amp cable in a moulded on plug many with an IEC 60320 C7 type plug rated by that standard at 25 Amps According to you the plug should therefore be fitted with a 3 Amp fuse determined by the cable If you did so you would never get any but the smallest power supplies running You have to fit a 5 Amp fuse because the very large 40 Amp momentary inrush current lasts long enough that it will blow a 3 Amp fuse The cable and plug can retain their original ratings because the inrush current will not harm them The rating of the fuse is determined by much much more than the cable size alone Indeed the type of power supply that is built into a plug usually has no fuse at all   1717,0.3972142

20,   Taxobox removal   I removed the taxobox The article seems to be about a common name that refers to most or all species of two cetacean families    This was reverted here with the edit summary Revert  information in infobox takes this into account provides useful information Dolphin is a common name for some species of the two families not a single scientific taxon The article explains this fact I would not remove useful information The specious inclusion is very misleading it is best explained in the article What reliable source would state it refers to these two taxa when some of them have the common name of whale Why should the taxobox be used for an article about a non systematic name    I wouldnt  have a problem with having two families in the taxobox except that under current taxonomy this one is now incorrect  I am not concerned about the fact that some dolphins have a common name of whale since most authoritative sources would recognize those species dolphin species despite the common name since all are in Delphinidae  But the problem is that the River Dolphins have now been split into multiple families so just using Delphinidae and Platanistoidea is no longer correct  And rather than include five families in the taxobox which becomes somewhat spurious it seems better to remove the taxobox and discuss the taxonomy in the article     What if the family section is just left out Or be given a note like See article I like the infobox and it does provide useful data and a basic glance at where dolphins fit in in the animal kingdom it never fails to amaze me how many people do not seem to realise dolphins are mammals Looking at some other articles theres no consensus on the infobox usage The whale article has no infobox for example while many others such as the shark lizard or turtle articles do have them     I have a problem with original research being used in our document This would include basing a taxon on a common name there is no concordance between common names and biological nomenclature A reader comes here to acquire facts those few who do not know they are mammals can gain that information from the content proper of the article The two families or even five are not given an accepted taxon the fact that some reliable sources also name some of the species as Dolphins is incidental not authoritative Everyone likes the taxobox let us be careful with our names here most of all it is not an infobox I appreciate that the undue weight given to other names appended to the correct name may cause this misapprehension but the consensus is that a taxobox should summarise a single taxon and be included in only one article Whale is without one for reasons that are intimately linked with this articles title The other examples you have given are hopefully given in RS that state unequivocally a common name refers to a taxon Sharks superorder Selachimorpha Lizards Suborder Lacertilia are a very large and widespread group of reptiles of the order Squamata highly debatable but still a single taxon and superorder Chelonia turtles is yet another reptilian Sauropsida example that needed resolving Removing duplicated or specious spurious taxoboxes is never popular with those who had a notion to include them Im not sure why but it is certain to be the right path for clarifying explanations to our dear readers An article on the common name dolphin is justified it could be more than a dab but it is not a taxon Please undo the unfounded revert of my edit    All dolphins belong to the suborder of Odontoceti every animal mentioned in this article does so the taxobox tree is correct especially considering my last edit  so no incorrect data is given in the box I dont feel the definition of a dolphin as used in this article is based on original research but is what is quite commonly accepted as what animals are covered under the word dolphin Encarta for example in my opinion a good source for reference also lists t,0.046120718

30,   Mutual funds are regulated by the SEC while hedge funds are notregulation in general   This is simply wrong  Investment Advisers the managers of hedge funds in the US are governed by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940  There are many aspects of the Act that apply both to registered and unregistered advisers  The most important of these provisions are antifraud measures  The SEC enforces the Act    Registered IAs can count on a visit from the SEC on a schedule determined by the adviserfunds perceived riskiness  To try and draw some kind of distinction between an adviser being regulated and a fund being regulated is pointless when the SEC visits they are empowered to review all aspects of an advisers funds  The SEC can use Rule 20648 under the Act to come in and look at an unregistered advisers funds as well    More it is ludicrous to state that hedge funds are largely unregulated although this phrase is repeated in the popular press frequently  In the US hedge funds may be regulated by the SEC CFTC FINRA various SROs and exchanges state securities regulators the Department of Labor and maybe others  In addition to the Act hedge funds are regulated under the Investment Company Act for exclusion from the definition of an Investment Company and the Securities Act of 1933 Regulation D  concerning sales of private securities  Any trading by direct investment hedge funds is subject to all the rules of FINRA and the exchanges    If anything regulation in the UK is even stricter  Solid regimes exist in other jurisdictions including Cayman and Bermuda  In short it is the case in the US and the UK among other major venues that hedge funds are highly regulated pools of capital  I will propose changes to the article as time permits   ,0.040183347

37, Unfortunately   This para isnt acceptable   Unfortunately UNESCO did not check the credentials of its partner who are engineers but not historians Ibn alHaytham did not lay the foundations of the present day but contributed with significant work to methods theories and observations that were developed and made in Antiquity and shared by many scholars whatever their ethnicity or religious affiliation in Islamicate and Christian societies of the Middle Ages and the early modern period Hence Ibn alHaytham certainly deserves our respect and appreciation as one of the great scholars of the 10th century and worthy to be mentioned with praise in all our modern cultures across the globe  in schoolbooks newspapers the TV the Internet or other media But we should not present him as the inventor of modern optics or todays scientific methods which are neither one nor the same even as in the 19th century  It may or may not be true but without any sources its just editorial interpolation,0.11378009
